# SVM-SVC---Practice--on-Student-Performance-Dataset
This repository contains a practical implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification using the SVC (Support Vector Classifier) from Scikit-learn, applied to a real-world dataset on student performance. The goal is to predict student performance categories (such as pass/fail or grade groups) based on features like study time, etc.
